## Experience

### Presence AI — Lead Backend Engineer, AI Pipeline
**April 2024 – February 2026 (1 year 10 months)**

- Architected and shipped the entire real-time video pipeline: facial landmark detection, LatentSync lip-sync inference (VAE decode, denoising, restoration), idle video generation, and frame sequencing on NVIDIA H100 GPUs via LiveKit
- Architected a multi-service AI monorepo with closed-loop agentic workflows and self-auditing development infrastructure (Claude Code / Codex)
- Developed an iterative agentic development methodology: lightweight living specs refined through closed-loop agent auditing and continuous human-in-the-loop feedback, accelerating design velocity while staying in flow with the emerging design
- Built reusable async primitives for high-quality agent-authored code and human comprehension: task lifecycle management, scoped cancellation, lazily resolved dependencies that decouple initialization order and cascade invalidation through the context, runtime profile logging, and stable cross-stack naming to maintain conceptual coherence for both human and agent reasoning
- Improved lip-sync quality through landmark temporal smoothing, LatentSync model upgrades, and optimized Whisper audio feature extraction via improved audio stream batching

### Open Source — Creator / Solo Developer
**2024 – Present**

- Built a git-native correspondence system that syncs topics, contacts, and threads from email (IMAP), Telegram, and Slack into scoped markdown mailboxes, with per-topic and per-contact agent context that propagates across collaborators via 3-way merge
- Designed multi-scope mailbox architecture where each collaborator receives only relevant threads and context, with bidirectional sync using content hashing (FNV-1a) and git-based conflict resolution for offline-first collaboration
- Implemented crash-safe incremental IMAP sync with streaming merge, bulk import for Slack and Telegram archives, and label-based routing rules that fan out threads to multiple mailboxes
- Dog-fooding daily for personal and professional correspondence across Gmail and Protonmail accounts

**agent-doc** — Document-as-Interface for Interactive Sessions with AI Agents (Rust)
[github.com/btakita/agent-doc](https://github.com/btakita/agent-doc)

- Created a document-as-interface model for persistent AI conversations: edit a markdown file offline, submit diffs, agent responds inline — all tracked through git commits for full session history and branch-based workflows
- Engineered write-safe concurrent editing via 3-way merge (snapshot + user edits + agent response), preventing data loss when human and agent edit simultaneously
- Built agent-agnostic core with pluggable LLM backends, automatic pre-commit of user changes, and snapshot-based diffing so only changed content is sent to the agent
- Dog-fooding as the primary interface for planning and iterating on both corky and agent-doc development
