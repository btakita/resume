## LinkedIn Headline (220 char max)

### Active — Hybrid (212 chars)
*Best for: LinkedIn profile, recruiter search, founder-level outreach*

> 20+ years full-stack | Architected real-time multimodal AI avatar pipeline at Presence AI | Building agent tooling & context engineering for collaborative intelligence | Reactive & event-driven systems

Pipe-separated format matches LinkedIn scan patterns. Names Presence AI for social proof. "Architected" signals shipped work.

### Narrative (187 chars)
*Best for: conference bios, personal blog, about pages*

> Building emergent software systems through agent loops & context engineering. 20+ yrs full-stack: reactive, event-driven, real-time AI pipelines. Multimodal avatar systems at Presence AI.

Reads as a mission statement. Leads with vision, closes with credibility. Better for contexts where voice matters more than keyword scanning.

## Resume Tagline

> Building emergent software systems through agent loops and context engineering — spec-driven development, automated verification, and collaborative intelligence tooling where agents and humans work in parallel with full context. 20+ years full-stack experience.

## Resume Summary

> Over 20 years building full-stack systems with deep expertise in reactive programming, event-driven architecture, and real-time pipelines. Most recently architected a real-time multimodal AI avatar pipeline — text, audio, and video lipsync — at Presence AI. Now building spec-driven agent tooling and collaborative intelligence workflows. A decade of context engineering — from a domain ontology system (2014) through reactive frameworks to modern agentic systems where humans and agents work in parallel with full context.
